##Beginner's Welcome!##


This is a simple update of a great tutorial written by [Ben Howdle](http://benhowdle.im/).

---

The original article, [Beginner's Guide to jQuery-based JSON API Clients](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2012/02/09/beginners-guide-jquery-based-json-api-clients/) appeared in Smashing Magazine circa Feb 2012. Go read it now…it's awesome, particularly if you're new to APIs and learn by doing. 

The original demo: [http://10k.aneventapart.com/2/Uploads/550/](http://10k.aneventapart.com/2/Uploads/550/)

The tutorial accessed a third-party API which has since been updated, so use this code if you want to follow along with the API's [updated documentation](http://help.themoviedb.org/kb).

PS - if you're new to Github and want to figure out what this pull request business is all about, feel free to send one over…there are a few clean-up items left in this update. The TODO list:

* Use the short-form getJSON call instead of the long-form AJAX call.
* DRY it up. Use variables for the urls.
* Add back the Lobster font (I didn't bother with Typekit).
